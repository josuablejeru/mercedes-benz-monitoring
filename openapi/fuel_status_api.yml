  description: "This API allows to determine the fuel level and remaining distance of connected Mercedes-Benz vehicles remotely.\nData is categorized into resources and containers for the polling interface. They are defined as follows:\n* *Resource*: A resource is a single information about a vehicle. It's a measurement that consists of a name (also referred to as resource ID), a value, and an associated timestamp. See below for a list and description of all resources that this API provides.\n* *Container*: A container is a set of resources that are defined to group data for a certain use case.\n\nThe interface is a ISO 20078-compliant REST endpoint to query the latest data for a vehicle. If the vehicle did not send an update for a resource within 12 hours, the response will be empty.\n## Resources\nThis is an alphabetical list of all resources that the API provides.\nName | Description | Unit/Range\n---- | ----------- | ----------\nrangeliquid | Liquid fuel tank range | 0..2046 km\ntanklevelpercent | \tLiquid fuel tank level | 0â€¦100 %\n"
