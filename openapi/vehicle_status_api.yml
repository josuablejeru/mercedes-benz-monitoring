  description: >
    This API allows to get status information of windows and doors, deck lid,
    rooftop or sunroof and interior lights of connected Mercedes-Benz vehicles
    remotely.

    Data is categorized into resources and containers for the polling interface.
    They are defined as follows:

    * *Resource*: A resource is a single information about a vehicle. It's a
    measurement that consists of a name (also referred to as resource ID), a
    value, and an associated timestamp. See below for a list and description of
    all resources that this API provides.

    * *Container*: A container is a set of resources that are defined to group
    data for a certain use case.


    The interface is a ISO 20078-compliant REST endpoint to query the latest
    data for a vehicle. If the vehicle did not send an update for a resource
    within 12 hours, the response will be empty.

    ## Resources

    This is an alphabetical list of all resources that the API provides.
